# Design Question: Making the gRPC Service Handle Many Requests

To make our service ready for 10,000 requests every second from many different locations, we need to think about a few key things:

## Making It Bigger (Horizontal Scaling)

* **Package and Manage with Tools:** We'll put our app into small, ready-to-run packages using something like **Docker**. Then, we'll use a smart manager like **Kubernetes** to easily make more copies of our app when lots of people are using it.
* **Share the Work:** We'll use a "load balancer" to send incoming requests evenly to all the copies of our service. Think of it like a traffic cop directing cars to different lanes. Kubernetes can do this, or we can use special tools like **NGINX**.

## Sharing gRPC Requests

* **Smart Clients:** The programs that send requests to our service can be smart. They can pick the best server copy to talk to, sharing the work directly. This is called "client-side load balancing" in gRPC.
* **Smart Servers:** We can also set things up on the server side to make sure requests are spread out nicely among different parts of our service.

## Keeping the Reports Safe (Storage)

* **Special Databases:** Instead of one big database, we'll use a "distributed database" like **Cassandra** or **DynamoDB**. These databases spread the report data across many computers and locations, making sure it's always available and can handle tons of new reports.
* **Quick Memory Storage:** For reports that are often looked at, we'll keep quick copies in a special fast memory area (a "cache") using tools like **Redis** or **Memcached**. This makes things faster because we don't have to ask the main database every time.

## Keeping It Running (Reliability)

* **Safety Switches:** We'll add "circuit breakers." Imagine a light switch that flips off if too much power goes through it. If one part of our service is having trouble, this switch stops other parts from sending it more requests, preventing a bigger problem.
* **Try Again:** If a request fails for a moment (like a small hiccup), we'll teach our service to "retry" it a few times. This helps it recover from small, quick issues.
* **Watch and Learn:** We need to keep a close eye on how the service is doing.
    * **Monitoring:** Tools like **Prometheus** and **Grafana** help us watch the service's health and performance. Think of it like a dashboard with all the vital signs.
    * **Logging:** We'll collect all the messages (logs) the service creates using a system like the **ELK stack**. This helps us understand what happened if something goes wrong.

By putting these ideas into action, our service can handle a lot of requests across different data centers without breaking down.
